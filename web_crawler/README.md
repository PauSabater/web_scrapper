# About this project

This project uses `PlaywrightCrawler` to recursively crawl https://crawlee.dev using the browser automation library [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).

The goal is to crawl verbs related open source data from [verbformen](https://www.verbformen.de) in order to build a database with verbs conjugations, informations and examples. This database will be later used to create an API.
